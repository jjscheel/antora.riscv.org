<p>RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is a new instruction-set architecture
(ISA) that was originally designed to support computer architecture
research and education, but which we now hope will also become a
standard free and open architecture for industry implementations. Our
goals in defining RISC-V include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A completely <em>open</em> ISA that is freely available to academia and
industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>real</em> ISA suitable for direct native hardware implementation, not
just simulation or binary translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ISA that avoids "over-architecting" for a particular
microarchitecture style (e.g., microcoded, in-order, decoupled,
out-of-order) or implementation technology (e.g., full-custom, ASIC,
FPGA), but which allows efficient implementation in any of these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ISA separated into a <em>small</em> base integer ISA, usable by itself as
a base for customized accelerators or for educational purposes, and
optional standard extensions, to support general-purpose software
development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for the revised 2008 IEEE-754 floating-point standard. cite:[ieee754-2008]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ISA supporting extensive ISA extensions and specialized variants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both 32-bit and 64-bit address space variants for applications,
operating system kernels, and hardware implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ISA with support for highly parallel multicore or manycore
implementations, including heterogeneous multiprocessors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional <em>variable-length instructions</em> to both expand available
instruction encoding space and to support an optional <em>dense instruction
encoding</em> for improved performance, static code size, and energy
efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fully virtualizable ISA to ease hypervisor development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ISA that simplifies experiments with new privileged architecture
designs.</p>

<p>The name RISC-V was chosen to represent the fifth major RISC ISA design
from UC Berkeley (RISC-I cite:[riscI-isca1981], RISC-II cite:[Katevenis:1983], SOAR cite:[Ungar:1984], and SPUR cite:[spur-jsscc1989] were the first
four). We also pun on the use of the Roman numeral "V" to signify
"variations" and "vectors", as support for a range of architecture
research, including various data-parallel accelerators, is an explicit
goal of the ISA design.</p>

The RISC-V ISA is defined avoiding implementation details as much as
possible (although commentary is included on implementation-driven
decisions) and should be read as the software-visible interface to a
wide variety of implementations rather than as the design of a
particular hardware artifact. The RISC-V manual is structured in two
volumes. This volume covers the design of the base <em>unprivileged</em>
instructions, including optional unprivileged ISA extensions.
Unprivileged instructions are those that are generally usable in all
privilege modes in all privileged architectures, though behavior might
vary depending on privilege mode and privilege architecture. The second
volume provides the design of the first ("classic") privileged
architecture. The manuals use IEC 80000-13:2008 conventions, with a byte
of 8 bits.</p>

<h3 id="_risc_v_hardware_platform_terminology"><a class="anchor" href="#_risc_v_hardware_platform_terminology"></a>RISC-V Hardware Platform Terminology</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A RISC-V hardware platform can contain one or more RISC-V-compatible
processing cores together with other non-RISC-V-compatible cores,
fixed-function accelerators, various physical memory structures, I/O
devices, and an interconnect structure to allow the components to
communicate.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A component is termed a <em>core</em> if it contains an independent instruction
fetch unit. A RISC-V-compatible core might support multiple
RISC-V-compatible hardware threads, or <em>harts</em>, through multithreading.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A RISC-V core might have additional specialized instruction-set
extensions or an added <em>coprocessor</em>. We use the term <em>coprocessor</em> to
refer to a unit that is attached to a RISC-V core and is mostly
sequenced by a RISC-V instruction stream, but which contains additional
architectural state and instruction-set extensions, and possibly some
limited autonomy relative to the primary RISC-V instruction stream.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use the term <em>accelerator</em> to refer to either a non-programmable
fixed-function unit or a core that can operate autonomously but is
specialized for certain tasks. In RISC-V systems, we expect many
programmable accelerators will be RISC-V-based cores with specialized
instruction-set extensions and/or customized coprocessors. An important
class of RISC-V accelerators are I/O accelerators, which offload I/O
processing tasks from the main application cores.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system-level organization of a RISC-V hardware platform can range
from a single-core microcontroller to a many-thousand-node cluster of
shared-memory manycore server nodes. Even small systems-on-a-chip might
be structured as a hierarchy of multicomputers and/or multiprocessors to
modularize development effort or to provide secure isolation between
subsystems.

<h3 id="_risc_v_software_execution_environments_and_harts"><a class="anchor" href="#_risc_v_software_execution_environments_and_harts"></a>RISC-V Software Execution Environments and Harts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The behavior of a RISC-V program depends on the execution environment in
which it runs. A RISC-V execution environment interface (EEI) defines
the initial state of the program, the number and type of harts in the
environment including the privilege modes supported by the harts, the
accessibility and attributes of memory and I/O regions, the behavior of
all legal instructions executed on each hart (i.e., the ISA is one
component of the EEI), and the handling of any interrupts or exceptions
raised during execution including environment calls. Examples of EEIs
include the Linux application binary interface (ABI), or the RISC-V
supervisor binary interface (SBI). The implementation of a RISC-V
execution environment can be pure hardware, pure software, or a
combination of hardware and software. For example, opcode traps and
software emulation can be used to implement functionality not provided
in hardware. Examples of execution environment implementations include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Bare metal" hardware platforms where harts are directly implemented
by physical processor threads and instructions have full access to the
physical address space. The hardware platform defines an execution
environment that begins at power-on reset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RISC-V operating systems that provide multiple user-level execution
environments by multiplexing user-level harts onto available physical
processor threads and by controlling access to memory via virtual
memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RISC-V hypervisors that provide multiple supervisor-level execution
environments for guest operating systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RISC-V emulators, such as Spike, QEMU or rv8, which emulate RISC-V
harts on an underlying x86 system, and which can provide either a
user-level or a supervisor-level execution environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A bare hardware platform can be considered to define an EEI, where the
accessible harts, memory, and other devices populate the environment,
and the initial state is that at power-on reset. Generally, most
software is designed to use a more abstract interface to the hardware,
as more abstract EEIs provide greater portability across different
hardware platforms. Often EEIs are layered on top of one another, where
one higher-level EEI uses another lower-level EEI.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
From the perspective of software running in a given execution
environment, a hart is a resource that autonomously fetches and executes
RISC-V instructions within that execution environment. In this respect,
a hart behaves like a hardware thread resource even if time-multiplexed
onto real hardware by the execution environment. Some EEIs support the
creation and destruction of additional harts, for example, via
environment calls to fork new harts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The execution environment is responsible for ensuring the eventual
forward progress of each of its harts. For a given hart, that
responsibility is suspended while the hart is exercising a mechanism
that explicitly waits for an event, such as the wait-for-interrupt
instruction defined in Volume II of this specification; and that
responsibility ends if the hart is terminated. The following events
constitute forward progress:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The retirement of an instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A trap, as defined in <a href="#trap-defn">Section 1.6</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other event defined by an extension to constitute forward
progress.</p>
</li>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term hart was introduced in the work on Lithe cite:[lithe-pan-hotpar09] and cite:[lithe-pan-pldi10] to provide a term to
represent an abstract execution resource as opposed to a software thread
programming abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The important distinction between a hardware thread (hart) and a
software thread context is that the software running inside an execution
environment is not responsible for causing progress of each of its
harts; that is the responsibility of the outer execution environment. So

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A RISC-V ISA is defined as a base integer ISA, which must be present in
any implementation, plus optional extensions to the base ISA. The base
integer ISAs are very similar to that of the early RISC processors
except with no branch delay slots and with support for optional
variable-length instruction encodings. A base is carefully restricted to
a minimal set of instructions sufficient to provide a reasonable target
for compilers, assemblers, linkers, and operating systems (with
additional privileged operations), and so provides a convenient ISA and
software toolchain "skeleton" around which more customized processor
ISAs can be built.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although it is convenient to speak of <em>the</em> RISC-V ISA, RISC-V is
actually a family of related ISAs, of which there are currently four
base ISAs. Each base integer instruction set is characterized by the
width of the integer registers and the corresponding size of the address
space and by the number of integer registers. There are two primary base
integer variants, RV32I and RV64I, described in
<a href="rv32.html" class="xref page">RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set</a> <a href="#rv32">[rv32]</a> and <a href="#rv64">[rv64]</a>, which provide 32-bit
or 64-bit address spaces respectively. We use the term XLEN to refer to
the width of an integer register in bits (either 32 or 64).
<a href="#rv32e">[rv32e]</a> describes the RV32E and RV64E subset variants of the
RV32I or RV64I base instruction sets respectively, which have been added to support small
microcontrollers, and which have half the number of integer registers.
<a href="#rv128">[rv128]</a> sketches a future RV128I variant of the
base integer instruction set supporting a flat 128-bit address space
(XLEN=128). The base integer instruction sets use a two&#8217;s-complement
representation for signed integer values.</p>

sufficient for educational purposes. A larger flat 128-bit address space
might eventually be required, so we ensured this could be accommodated

<p>The four base ISAs in RISC-V are treated as distinct base ISAs. A common
question is why is there not a single ISA, and in particular, why is
RV32I not a strict subset of RV64I? Some earlier ISA designs (SPARC,
MIPS) adopted a strict superset policy when increasing address space
size to support running existing 32-bit binaries on new 64-bit hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main advantage of explicitly separating base ISAs is that each base
ISA can be optimized for its needs without requiring to support all the
operations needed for other base ISAs. For example, RV64I can omit
instructions and CSRs that are only needed to cope with the narrower
registers in RV32I. The RV32I variants can use encoding space otherwise
reserved for instructions only required by wider address-space variants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main disadvantage of not treating the design as a single ISA is that
it complicates the hardware needed to emulate one base ISA on another
(e.g., RV32I on RV64I). However, differences in addressing and
illegal-instruction traps generally mean some mode switch would be required in
hardware in any case even with full superset instruction encodings, and
the different RISC-V base ISAs are similar enough that supporting
multiple versions is relatively low cost. Although some have proposed
that the strict superset design would allow legacy 32-bit libraries to
be linked with 64-bit code, this is impractical in practice, even with
compatible encodings, due to the differences in software calling
conventions and system-call interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RISC-V privileged architecture provides fields in <code>misa</code> to control
the unprivileged ISA at each level to support emulating different base
ISAs on the same hardware. We note that newer SPARC and MIPS ISA
revisions have deprecated support for running 32-bit code unchanged on
64-bit systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A related question is why there is a different encoding for 32-bit adds
in RV32I (ADD) and RV64I (ADDW)? The ADDW opcode could be used for
32-bit adds in RV32I and ADDD for 64-bit adds in RV64I, instead of the
existing design which uses the same opcode ADD for 32-bit adds in RV32I
and 64-bit adds in RV64I with a different opcode ADDW for 32-bit adds in
RV64I. This would also be more consistent with the use of the same LW
opcode for 32-bit load in both RV32I and RV64I. The very first versions
of RISC-V ISA did have a variant of this alternate design, but the
RISC-V design was changed to the current choice in January 2011. Our
focus was on supporting 32-bit integers in the 64-bit ISA not on
providing compatibility with the 32-bit ISA, and the motivation was to
remove the asymmetry that arose from having not all opcodes in RV32I
have a *W suffix (e.g., ADDW, but AND not ANDW). In hindsight, this was
perhaps not well-justified and a consequence of designing both ISAs at
the same time as opposed to adding one later to sit on top of another,
and also from a belief we had to fold platform requirements into the ISA
spec which would imply that all the RV32I instructions would have been
required in RV64I. It is too late to change the encoding now, but this
is also of little practical consequence for the reasons stated above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has been noted we could enable the *W variants as an extension to
RV32I systems to provide a common encoding across RV64I and a future
RV32 variant.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>RISC-V has been designed to support extensive customization and
specialization. Each base integer ISA can be extended with one or more
optional instruction-set extensions. An extension may be categorized as
either standard, custom, or non-conforming. For this purpose, we divide
each RISC-V instruction-set encoding space (and related encoding spaces
such as the CSRs) into three disjoint categories: <em>standard</em>,
<em>reserved</em>, and <em>custom</em>. Standard extensions and encodings are defined
by RISC-V International; any extensions not defined by RISC-V International are
<em>non-standard</em>. Each base ISA and its standard extensions use only
standard encodings, and shall not conflict with each other in their uses
of these encodings. Reserved encodings are currently not defined but are
saved for future standard extensions; once thus used, they become
standard encodings. Custom encodings shall never be used for standard
extensions and are made available for vendor-specific non-standard
extensions. Non-standard extensions are either custom extensions, that
use only custom encodings, or <em>non-conforming</em> extensions, that use any
standard or reserved encoding. Instruction-set extensions are generally
shared but may provide slightly different functionality depending on the
base ISA. <a href="#extending">[extending]</a> describes various ways
of extending the RISC-V ISA. We have also developed a naming convention
for RISC-V base instructions and instruction-set extensions, described
in detail in <a href="#naming">[naming]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support more general software development, a set of standard
extensions are defined to provide integer multiply/divide, atomic
operations, and single and double-precision floating-point arithmetic.
The base integer ISA is named "I" (prefixed by RV32 or RV64 depending
on integer register width), and contains integer computational
instructions, integer loads, integer stores, and control-flow
instructions. The standard integer multiplication and division extension
is named "M", and adds instructions to multiply and divide values held
in the integer registers. The standard atomic instruction extension,
denoted by "A", adds instructions that atomically read, modify, and
write memory for inter-processor synchronization. The standard
single-precision floating-point extension, denoted by "F", adds
floating-point registers, single-precision computational instructions,
and single-precision loads and stores. The standard double-precision
floating-point extension, denoted by "D", expands the floating-point
registers, and adds double-precision computational instructions, loads,
and stores. The standard "C" compressed instruction extension provides
narrower 16-bit forms of common instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond the base integer ISA and these standard extensions, we believe
it is rare that a new instruction will provide a significant benefit for
all applications, although it may be very beneficial for a certain
domain. As energy efficiency concerns are forcing greater
specialization, we believe it is important to simplify the required
portion of an ISA specification. Whereas other architectures usually
treat their ISA as a single entity, which changes to a new version as
instructions are added over time, RISC-V will endeavor to keep the base
and each standard extension constant over time, and instead layer new
instructions as further optional extensions. For example, the base
integer ISAs will continue as fully supported standalone ISAs,
regardless of any subsequent extensions.</p>

<p>Executing each RISC-V machine instruction entails one or more memory
accesses, subdivided into <em>implicit</em> and <em>explicit</em> accesses. For each
instruction executed, an <em>implicit</em> memory read (instruction fetch) is
done to obtain the encoded instruction to execute. Many RISC-V
instructions perform no further memory accesses beyond instruction
fetch. Specific load and store instructions perform an <em>explicit</em> read
or write of memory at an address determined by the instruction. The
execution environment may dictate that instruction execution performs
other <em>implicit</em> memory accesses (such as to implement address
translation) beyond those documented for the unprivileged ISA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The execution environment determines what portions of the
address space are accessible for each kind of memory access. For
example, the set of locations that can be implicitly read for
instruction fetch may or may not have any overlap with the set of
locations that can be explicitly read by a load instruction; and the set
of locations that can be explicitly written by a store instruction may
be only a subset of locations that can be read. Ordinarily, if an
instruction attempts to access memory at an inaccessible address, an
exception is raised for the instruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Except when specified otherwise, implicit reads that do not raise an
exception and that have no side effects may occur arbitrarily early and
speculatively, even before the machine could possibly prove that the
read will be needed. For instance, a valid implementation could attempt
to read all of main memory at the earliest opportunity, cache as many
fetchable (executable) bytes as possible for later instruction fetches,
and avoid reading main memory for instruction fetches ever again. To
ensure that certain implicit reads are ordered only after writes to the
same memory locations, software must execute specific fence or
cache-control instructions defined for this purpose (such as the FENCE.I
instruction defined in <a href="#zifencei">[zifencei]</a>).

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The memory accesses (implicit or explicit) made by a hart may appear to
occur in a different order as perceived by another hart or by any other
agent that can access the same memory. This perceived reordering of
memory accesses is always constrained, however, by the applicable memory
consistency model. The default memory consistency model for RISC-V is
the RISC-V Weak Memory Ordering (RVWMO), defined in
<a href="#memorymodel">[memorymodel]</a> and in appendices. Optionally,
an implementation may adopt the stronger model of Total Store Ordering,
as defined in <a href="#ztso">[ztso]</a>. The execution environment
may also add constraints that further limit the perceived reordering of
memory accesses. Since the RVWMO model is the weakest model allowed for
any RISC-V implementation, software written for this model is compatible
with the actual memory consistency rules of all RISC-V implementations.
As with implicit reads, software must execute fence or cache-control
instructions to ensure specific ordering of memory accesses beyond the
requirements of the assumed memory consistency model and execution
environment.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use the term <em>exception</em> to refer to an unusual condition occurring
at run time associated with an instruction in the current RISC-V hart.
We use the term <em>interrupt</em> to refer to an external asynchronous event
that may cause a RISC-V hart to experience an unexpected transfer of
control. We use the term <em>trap</em> to refer to the transfer of control to a
trap handler caused by either an exception or an interrupt.


</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The instruction descriptions in following chapters describe conditions
that can raise an exception during execution. The general behavior of
most RISC-V EEIs is that a trap to some handler occurs when an exception
is signaled on an instruction (except for floating-point exceptions,
which, in the standard floating-point extensions, do not cause traps).
The manner in which interrupts are generated, routed to, and enabled by
a hart depends on the EEI.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>How traps are handled and made visible to software running on the hart
depends on the enclosing execution environment. From the perspective of
software running inside an execution environment, traps encountered by a
hart at runtime can have four different effects:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Contained Trap</dt>
<dd>
<p>The trap is visible to, and handled by, software running inside the
execution environment. For example, in an EEI providing both
supervisor and user mode on harts, an ECALL by a user-mode hart will
generally result in a transfer of control to a supervisor-mode handler
running on the same hart. Similarly, in the same environment, when a
hart is interrupted, an interrupt handler will be run in supervisor
mode on the hart.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Requested Trap</dt>
<dd>
<p>The trap is a synchronous exception that is an explicit call to the
execution environment requesting an action on behalf of software
inside the execution environment. An example is a system call. In this
case, execution may or may not resume on the hart after the requested
action is taken by the execution environment. For example, a system
call could remove the hart or cause an orderly termination of the
entire execution environment.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Invisible Trap</dt>
<dd>
<p>The trap is handled transparently by the execution environment and
execution resumes normally after the trap is handled. Examples include
emulating missing instructions, handling non-resident page faults in a
demand-paged virtual-memory system, or handling device interrupts for
a different job in a multiprogrammed machine. In these cases, the
software running inside the execution environment is not aware of the
trap (we ignore timing effects in these definitions).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fatal Trap</dt>
<dd>
<p>The trap represents a fatal failure and causes the execution
environment to terminate execution. Examples include failing a
virtual-memory page-protection check or allowing a watchdog timer to
expire. Each EEI should define how execution is terminated and
reported to an external environment.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EEI defines for each trap whether it is handled precisely, though
the recommendation is to maintain preciseness where possible. Contained
and requested traps can be observed to be imprecise by software inside
the execution environment. Invisible traps, by definition, cannot be
observed to be precise or imprecise by software running inside the
execution environment. Fatal traps can be observed to be imprecise by
software running inside the execution environment, if known-errorful
instructions do not cause immediate termination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because this document describes unprivileged instructions, traps are
rarely mentioned. Architectural means to handle contained traps are
defined in the privileged architecture manual, along with other features
to support richer EEIs. Unprivileged instructions that are defined
solely to cause requested traps are documented here. Invisible traps
are, by their nature, out of scope for this document. Instruction
encodings that are not defined here and not defined by some other means
may cause a fatal trap.</p>

<p>The architecture fully describes what implementations must do and any
constraints on what they may do. In cases where the architecture
intentionally does not constrain implementations, the term UNSPECIFIED is
explicitly used.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term UNSPECIFIED refers to a behavior or value that is intentionally
unconstrained. The definition of these behaviors or values is open to
extensions, platform standards, or implementations. Extensions, platform
standards, or implementation documentation may provide normative content
to further constrain cases that the base architecture defines as UNSPECIFIED.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like the base architecture, extensions should fully describe allowable
behavior and values and use the term UNSPECIFIED for cases that are intentionally
unconstrained. These cases may be constrained or defined by other
extensions, platform standards, or implementations.</p>
