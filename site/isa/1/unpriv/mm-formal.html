<p>To facilitate formal analysis of RVWMO, this chapter presents a set of

provided in <a href="#memorymodel">Chapter 17</a> and in the rest of

<p>The tool <span class="sans-serif">herd</span> takes a memory model and a litmus test as

<h3 id="operational"><a class="anchor" href="#operational"></a>An Operational Memory Model</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an alternative presentation of the RVWMO memory model in
operational style. It aims to admit exactly the same extensional
behavior as the axiomatic presentation: for any given program, admitting
an execution if and only if the axiomatic presentation allows it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The axiomatic presentation is defined as a predicate on complete
candidate executions. In contrast, this operational presentation has an
abstract microarchitectural flavor: it is expressed as a state machine,
with states that are an abstract representation of hardware machine
states, and with explicit out-of-order and speculative execution (but
abstracting from more implementation-specific microarchitectural details
such as register renaming, store buffers, cache hierarchies, cache
protocols, etc.). As such, it can provide useful intuition. It can also
construct executions incrementally, making it possible to interactively
and randomly explore the behavior of larger examples, while the
axiomatic model requires complete candidate executions over which the
axioms can be checked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The operational presentation covers mixed-size execution, with
potentially overlapping memory accesses of different power-of-two byte
sizes. Misaligned accesses are broken up into single-byte accesses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The operational model, together with a fragment of the RISC-V ISA
semantics (RV64I and A), are integrated into the <code>rmem</code> exploration tool
(<a href="https://github.com/rems-project/rmem" class="bare">https://github.com/rems-project/rmem</a>). <code>rmem</code> can explore litmus tests
(see <a href="#litmustests">[litmustests]</a>) and small ELF binaries
exhaustively, pseudorandomly and interactively. In <code>rmem</code>, the ISA
semantics is expressed explicitly in Sail (see
<a href="https://github.com/rems-project/sail" class="bare">https://github.com/rems-project/sail</a> for the Sail language, and
<a href="https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv" class="bare">https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv</a> for the RISC-V ISA model),
and the concurrency semantics is expressed in Lem (see
<a href="https://github.com/rems-project/lem" class="bare">https://github.com/rems-project/lem</a> for the Lem language).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>rmem</code> has a command-line interface and a web-interface. The
web-interface runs entirely on the client side, and is provided online
together with a library of litmus tests:
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/" class="bare">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/</a>. The command-line interface is
faster than the web-interface, specially in exhaustive mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below is an informal introduction of the model states and transitions.
The description of the formal model starts in the next subsection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Terminology: In contrast to the axiomatic presentation, here every
memory operation is either a load or a store. Hence, AMOs give rise to
two distinct memory operations, a load and a store. When used in
conjunction with <code>instruction</code>, the terms <code>load</code> and <code>store</code> refer
to instructions that give rise to such memory operations. As such, both
include AMO instructions. The term <code>acquire</code> refers to an instruction
(or its memory operation) with the acquire-RCpc or acquire-RCsc
annotation. The term <code>release</code> refers to an instruction (or its memory
operation) with the release-RCpc or release-RCsc annotation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Model states</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Model states: A model state consists of a shared memory and a tuple of hart states.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock center kroki">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://kroki.io/ditaa/svg/eNrT1oUDbQUQ0EbwuWoUFDwSi0oUDBQUahT09PSApEJIUWJyKpDPpY1PJ5D7qG0iWPhR22QFGEASQ9aPDsA2g0FwRmJRaopCbmpuflElRKgGr04AO8stKw==?shadows=false&separation=false" alt="Diagram">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shared memory state records all the memory store operations that
have propagated so far, in the order they propagated (this can be made
more efficient, but for simplicity of the presentation we keep it this
way).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each hart state consists principally of a tree of instruction instances,
some of which have been <em>finished</em>, and some of which have not.
Non-finished instruction instances can be subject to <em>restart</em>, e.g. if
they depend on an out-of-order or speculative load that turns out to be
unsound.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conditional branch and indirect jump instructions may have multiple
successors in the instruction tree. When such instruction is finished,
any un-taken alternative paths are discarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each instruction instance in the instruction tree has a state that
includes an execution state of the intra-instruction semantics (the ISA
pseudocode for this instruction). The model uses a formalization of the
intra-instruction semantics in Sail. One can think of the execution
state of an instruction as a representation of the pseudocode control
state, pseudocode call stack, and local variable values. An instruction
instance state also includes information about the instance&#8217;s memory and
register footprints, its register reads and writes, its memory
operations, whether it is finished, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Model transitions</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The model defines, for any model state, the set of allowed transitions,
each of which is a single atomic step to a new abstract machine state.
Execution of a single instruction will typically involve many
transitions, and they may be interleaved in operational-model execution
with transitions arising from other instructions. Each transition arises
from a single instruction instance; it will change the state of that
instance, and it may depend on or change the rest of its hart state and
the shared memory state, but it does not depend on other hart states,
and it will not change them. The transitions are introduced below and
defined in <a href="#transitions">Transitions</a>, with a precondition and
a construction of the post-transition model state for each.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transitions for all instructions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#fetch">Fetch instruction</a>: This transition represents a fetch and decode of a new instruction instance, as a program order successor of a previously fetched
instruction instance (or the initial fetch address).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The model assumes the instruction memory is fixed; it does not describe
the behavior of self-modifying code. In particular, the <a href="#fetch">Fetch instruction</a> transition does
not generate memory load operations, and the shared memory is not
involved in the transition. Instead, the model depends on an external
oracle that provides an opcode when given a memory location.</p>

discarded, together with the sub-tree of instruction instances below
them.</p>

abstraction is not detailed enough to properly handle the <code>sc</code>

these addresses are easily obtained from the instruction pseudocode. The
only exception to that is the indirect jump instruction (<code>jalr</code>), where
the address depends on the value held in a register. In principle the
mathematical model should allow speculation to arbitrary addresses here.
The exhaustive search in the <code>rmem</code> tool handles this by running the
exhaustive search multiple times with a growing set of possible next
fetch addresses for each indirect jump. The initial search uses empty
sets, hence there is no fetch after indirect jump instruction until the
pseudocode of the instruction writes to <em>pc</em>, and then we use that value
for fetching the next instruction. Before starting the next iteration of
exhaustive search, we collect for each indirect jump (grouped by code
location) the set of values it wrote to <em>pc</em> in all the executions in

addresses of the instruction. This process terminates when no new fetch
